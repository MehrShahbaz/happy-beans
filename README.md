## Description

This project allows users to schedule their meal orders based on their preferences, dislikes, allergies, and dietary choices such as vegan, vegetarian, non-vegan, or halal. The app filters restaurants according to the user’s settings, and once a restaurant is selected, it enables the user to place an order for their desired menu items during the restaurant’s available hours.
