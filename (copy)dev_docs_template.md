## Code Conventions

### General Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Comment complex business logic and non-obvious implementations

### Language-Specific Conventions

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `getUserData()`
- Use PascalCase for classes and components: `UserProfile`
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `API_BASE_URL`
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use semicolons consistently
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use template literals for string interpolation

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use snake_case for variables and functions: `get_user_data()`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `UserProfile`
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants: `API_BASE_URL`
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values

#### CSS/SCSS
- Use kebab-case for class names: `.user-profile`
- Use BEM methodology for component styling
- Group properties logically (positioning, display, colors, etc.)
- Use meaningful class names that describe purpose, not appearance

## Branching Strategy

### Git Flow Model
We use a modified Git Flow with the following branch types:

#### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, staging environment

#### Supporting Branches
- **`feature/*`**: New features and enhancements
  - Naming: `feature/ticket-number-short-description`
  - Example: `feature/USER-123-user-authentication`
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge to: `develop`

- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fixes for development
  - Naming: `bugfix/ticket-number-short-description`
  - Example: `bugfix/BUG-456-login-validation-error`
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge to: `develop`

- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical fixes for production
  - Naming: `hotfix/ticket-number-short-description`
  - Example: `hotfix/CRIT-789-security-vulnerability`
  - Branch from: `main`
  - Merge to: `main` and `develop`

- **`release/*`**: Prepare new production releases
  - Naming: `release/version-number`
  - Example: `release/1.2.0`
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge to: `main` and `develop`

### Branch Protection Rules
- `main` and `develop` branches require pull request reviews
- Status checks must pass before merging
- Branch must be up to date before merging
- Administrators cannot bypass these requirements

## Commit Message Format

### Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Changes to documentation
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, libraries
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add user registration endpoint

Implement user registration with email validation and password hashing.
Includes input validation and error handling.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(ui): resolve mobile navigation menu overlap

The mobile menu was overlapping with main content on smaller screens.
Updated z-index and positioning to fix the issue.

Fixes #456
```

### Guidelines
- Use imperative mood in subject line ("add" not "added")
- Capitalize first letter of subject
- No period at end of subject line
- Subject line should be 50 characters or less
- Body should explain what and why, not how
- Reference issues and pull requests in footer

## Code Review Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements
- [ ] No commented-out code

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code is readable and well-structured
- [ ] Logic is sound and efficient
- [ ] Edge cases are handled
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance implications considered
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete

### Review Process
1. Author creates pull request with clear description
2. At least 2 team members review the code
3. Address all feedback before approval
4. Squash commits when merging to maintain clean history
5. Delete feature branch after successful merge

## Testing Standards

### Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: 70% - Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: 20% - Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: 10% - Test complete user workflows

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- All public methods must have tests

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('getUserById', () => {
    it('should return user data for valid ID', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      const expectedUser = { id: '123', name: 'John Doe' };
      
      // Act
      const result = await UserService.getUserById(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(expectedUser);
    });
  });
});
```

### Test Naming Convention
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Format: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include parameter types and return values
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

### README Requirements
Every project should include:
- Project description and purpose
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation (if applicable)
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and messages
- Keep documentation in sync with implementation

## Deployment Process

### Environments
- **Development**: Feature branches, continuous deployment
- **Staging**: `develop` branch, automated testing
- **Production**: `main` branch, manual approval required

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Code pushed to branch
2. Automated tests run
3. Security and quality scans
4. Build artifacts created
5. Deploy to appropriate environment
6. Health checks and smoke tests
7. Notification to team

### Rollback Procedure
- Automated rollback triggers for critical errors
- Manual rollback process documented
- Database migration rollback strategy
- Communication plan for incidents

## Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. Pull latest changes from `develop`
2. Create feature branch from `develop`
3. Make changes following conventions
4. Write tests for new functionality
5. Run tests locally and ensure they pass
6. Commit changes with proper message format
7. Push branch and create pull request
8. Request code review from team members
9. Address feedback and make necessary changes
10. Merge to `develop` after approval

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature requirements met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or properly communicated)
- [ ] Deployed to staging and tested
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received

### Tools and IDE Setup
- **Linting**: ESLint, Pylint, or equivalent
- **Formatting**: Prettier, Black, or equivalent
- **Git hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
- **IDE extensions**: Language-specific extensions for consistency

### Communication
- Use project management tools for task tracking
- Daily standups for progress updates
- Document decisions in team wiki or ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Notify team of breaking changes or major updates
